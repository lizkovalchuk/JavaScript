//Amasean offers free shipping once the total purchases are more than $35
//Let the shopper know when they cross the free shipping threshold

//Create an array to hold the shopping cart items.

var items = [];

//As long as the shipping threshold hasnâ€™t been met, a popup box
//will ask the user for the dollar value of each new item.

//a while loop is perfect for this
//create an incrementor to plug into your array
